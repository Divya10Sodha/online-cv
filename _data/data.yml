  - title: Terrorism Analytics: Learning to Predict the Perpetrator 
    intro: >
           Machine learning Approach was followed in this project. Identifying the perpetrator is very important part of Terrorism Analytics. So, various models were built to predict the perpetrator, i.e. the Terrorist group responsible for attack. Python and Apache Spark were used to build the models. The best model was found out through K-Folds Cross Validation Technique.

  - title: Automatic Instrument System to Record & Identify Nocturnal Bird Call with Various Weather Parameters 
    intro: >
           An automatic instrument system was developed which would record only required frequency and amplitude-range of a nocturnal bird calls at a particular location along with its weather parameters like temperature, humidity and light intensity with the help of raspberry pi and sensors. The data was analyzed and the bird was identified from the recorded sound making use of Matlab. The required results were provided in the client web application.
